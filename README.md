# ☁️ Clifton Cloudworks 🚀

**Helping startups and SMEs scale with Kubernetes, GitOps, and honest engineering.**

---

👋 Welcome to the repository for the **Clifton Cloudworks** website! This is the digital home of a Bristol-based cloud engineering consultancy that bridges the gap between complex infrastructure and scalable product delivery. We turn "it works on my machine" into "it creates value in production" (and we make it look good while doing it!).

## ✨ Features

This isn't your average Jekyll site. It's been customized with a unique "Techno-Organic" aesthetic:

- **🎨 Custom Theme**: A deep olive/green "Dark Forest" theme with glassmorphism effects.
- **🌊 Dynamic Backgrounds**: Responsive wave animations and subtle glowing ambiances.
- **📱 Mobile First**: Fully optimized for small screens with touch-friendly targets and reduced motion support.
- **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Static site generation means zero-downtime and instant loads.
- **📝 Content Rich**: Dedicated pages for Services, Tech Stack, and Personal Portfolio.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Want to run this locally? It's as easy as deploying a Hello World pod (actually, easier).

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby** (v2.7 or higher recommended)
- **Bundler** (`gem install bundler`)

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clifton-cloudworks.git
    cd clifton-cloudworks
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3.  **Ignition! 🚀**
    Start the local development server:

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

4.  **View the Magic:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.

## ⚙️ Project Specifics

- **Configuration**: Main site settings (title, author, nav links) are in `_config.yml`.
- **Styling**: The heavy lifting for the custom theme happens in `assets/css/clifton-theme.css`. This file overrides the base `beautiful-jekyll` styles to give us that sweet, sweet glass-panel look.
- **Backgrounds**: Checked out `assets/js/tech-background.js`? That's where the geometric floating particles live (desktop only!).
