With the current tech landscape evolving rapidly, it's hard to know what the right approach is to deploying software into the cloud.

I can work closely with entrepreneurs and small businesses to take their ideas from source code to running in production in the cloud.

Whether you're local to Bristol and want a more personalise experience, or from afar and remote communication is more your style, I am happy to accomodate to your preference. 

To reach out, please contact me on: [hello@bristolcloudworks.co.uk](mailto:hello@bristolcloudworks.co.uk)

But it doesn't stop there! I am happy to work with you to help you solve any other tech related issues, but I specialise only in modern tech. 

# 👶 Entrepreneurs

It can be very difficult to know where to start when it comes to deploying software into the cloud. Especially when you're taking your own idea to the market for the first time. 

I will work with you to ensure that the foundation for your product delivery is setup in a way that can be easily scaled as you organically grow. You will have full ownership of any code that is produced as part of the process, and will get full support throughout your journey.

# 🏤 SMEs

I can work with SMEs to overcome any deployment challenges they are currently facing. This may be due to poorly setup foundation, or just a lack of knowledge in how they should be scaling up in the cloud space. I am happy to share knowledge, create the appropriate workflows and automation to facilitate this.
